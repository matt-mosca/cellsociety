* My design is hiding the instance variables and how the logic of each simulation from the front end. 
* I am intend to build a cell super class and simulation super class.
* Super classes are open so that people can add more sub classes to it but every sub class is closed to ensure no damage is made.
* We have separated the super class and sub class, which make the hierarchies and structures easy to modify.
* My area is linked to front end through 2D array.
* These dependencies cannot be avoided due to the nature of interaction between front end and back end.
